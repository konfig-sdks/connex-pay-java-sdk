|**sendReceipt** | **Boolean** | Value determines whether or not a customer shall be emailed a receipt from the ConnexPay platform if the email address is provided in the API customer block.

|**riskProcessingOnly** | **Boolean** | Indicator that determines if client would like to evaluate the transactions as risk only rather than process as merchant of record and create a virtual card. The allowed values:  1. Set to TRUE will only run risk validations. If TenderType is not set to Credit, setting TRUE will throw a validation error.  2. Set to FALSE will run risk validations and an authorization on the card. For this option a Processing Merchant account is required, contact ConnexPay support if any questions.  3.
