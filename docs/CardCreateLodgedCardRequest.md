|**labelIDs** | **List&lt;String&gt;** | Utilize Label IDs to associate a lodged card to a specific label(s) within ConnexPay Bridge UI for your organization.

Please contact your Customer Care Consultant for a list of valid Label IDs before use. |  [optional] |
|**customParameters** | [**List&lt;CardIssuanceCreateVirtualCardRequestCustomParametersInner&gt;**](CardIssuanceCreateVirtualCardRequestCustomParametersInner.md) | You can add custom parameters to your issue card request in the event that you need to associate additional information with the virtual card. For example, if you want to add an invoice number you would include the custom parameters object with the name parameter &#x3D; \&quot;invoice\&quot; and the value parameter as the invoice number. This requires customized reporting so you&#39;ll need to work with your implementations specialist to determine what&#39;s required. |  [optional] |
