|**usageLimit** | **Long** | Security Control: Maximum number of times the card may be authorized. The maximum allowed field value is 99, and if you do not provide a value the card will be considered unlimited. Authorization attempts exceeding the provided value will be declined. Even though a virtual card is often considered a “one-time-use” card, some suppliers may need to authorize a card multiple times (pre-authorizations, a purchase comprised of multiple tickets, etc.) and you may consider a value that is not overly restrictive to avoid unwanted declines. |  [optional] |
|**amountLimit** | **Float** | Security Control: Maximum dollar amount the card can be authorized and settled, which must be less than or equal to $1,000,000.00. The value must incorporate any anticipated overages such as currency conversion or taxes that a supplier may associate with the transaction. If a supplier attempts to authorize a card for more than the amount limit it will be declined. |  |
|**expirationDate** | **LocalDate** | The ExpirationDate (YYYY-MM-DD) is the date to be provided to the supplier as the actual expiration date for the virtual card. The recommendation is to set the ExpirationDate one or two years in the future and set the TerminateDate just a day or two after the VCC is expected to be processed to avoid acceptance issues.  The expiration date cannot be more than 36 months in the future. If an expiration date is not provided, the expiration will default to issue date plus three years. For cards issued outside of the US/Canada, the expiration date will default to issue date plus three years and can not be overwritten - even if this parameter is included in the request. Note, Returns can still be processed on expired or terminated VCCs. |  [optional] |
|**terminateDate** | **LocalDate** | The TerminateDate (YYYY-MM-DD format) is the date the Virtual Credit Card will be terminated by ConnexPay. TerminateDate is different than ExpirationDate in that TerminateDate indicates the actual date the card will no longer be active.  The recommendation is to set the ExpirationDate one or two years in the future and set the TerminateDate just a day or two after the VCC is expected to be processed. If a terminate date is not indicated, the card will be inactivated as of the expiration date. Note, Returns can still be processed on terminated VCCs. |  [optional] |
|**purchaseType** | **String** | Security Control: The industry where the virtual card will be utilized. For example, if value set to airline and the card is used at hotel, it will be declined.

[&#39;273514000108778&#39;, &#39;900074KLM&#39;]) |  [optional] |
|**miDBlacklist** | **List&lt;String&gt;** | MID &#x3D; Merchant ID. The list of MIDs where the virtual card will always be DECLINED regardless of PurchaseType or MIDWhitelist. MIDBlacklist overrides all other specifications. (eg. [&#39;273594000108778&#39;].) |  [optional] |

|**incomingTransactionCode** | **String** | ITC for short Application level setting to associate the virtual card request with an original sale or sale group.

|**transmission** | [**CardIssuanceCreateVirtualCardRequestTransmission**](CardIssuanceCreateVirtualCardRequestTransmission.md) |  |  [optional] |
|**returnCardData** | **Boolean** | Optional field that may be set to true or false. When set to a value of true or if the field is not provided at all, card data is returned in the response.

|**customerID** | **String** | Transaction ID within client environment associated with the customer. This value acts as a secondary identifier in conjunction with OrderNumber.

|**associationId** | **String** | Utilize the Association ID field to tie a virtual card to a sale or sales. For example, if you have several sales and one virtual card payment to a supplier, you can add association ID to the sales and the virtual card for downstream reporting. |  [optional] |
|**customParameters** | [**List&lt;CardIssuanceCreateVirtualCardRequestCustomParametersInner&gt;**](CardIssuanceCreateVirtualCardRequestCustomParametersInner.md) | You can add custom parameters to your issue card request in the event that you need to associate additional information with the virtual card. For example, if you want to add an invoice number you would include the custom parameters object with the name parameter &#x3D; \&quot;invoice\&quot; and the value parameter as the invoice number. This requires customized reporting so you&#39;ll need to work with your implementations specialist to determine what&#39;s required. |  [optional] |
|**labelIDs** | **List&lt;String&gt;** | Utilize Label IDs to associate a virtual card to a specific label(s) within ConnexPay Bridge UI for your organization.
